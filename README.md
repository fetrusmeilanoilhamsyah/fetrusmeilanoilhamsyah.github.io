# Personal Portfolio Website

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website.

I use this site to show what I do, how I work, and a few things I’ve built along the way.  
Nothing fancy — just a simple, fast website hosted on GitHub Pages.

## What’s inside
- One-page portfolio website
- Custom HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Responsive layout (desktop & mobile)
- Lightweight and fast loading

## Why I built this
I wanted a place where people can quickly understand:
- who I am
- what kind of work I do
- and how to reach me

Instead of sending long explanations, I just share this link.

## Tech stack
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- GitHub Pages

No framework, no build tools — just plain web basics.

## Structure
- `index.html` → main page
- `style.css` → styling
- `script.js` → small interactions
- `images/` → site assets
- `sitemap.xml` → basic SEO support

## Live site
You can view the website here:

## Notes
This site is updated gradually as I improve the content and layout.  
It’s meant to stay simple and readable.
